# oauth2_proxy

A reverse proxy and static file server that provides authentication using Providers (Google, GitHub, and others)
to validate accounts by email, domain or group.

**Note**: this is a fork of [pusher/oauth2_proxy](https://github.com/pusher/oauth2_proxy) for my personal needs. You should probably use the "official" pusher version instead.
